A thrilling chase sequence ensues through the streets and rooftops of Dubai, showcasing the city's stunning architecture and futuristic landscape. \n",
      "\n",

A fierce battle of technology and wits unfolds, with Raj and Aria using their combined skills to outsmart Maya and disable her control over others. \n",
